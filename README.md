# Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
With the development of data science, prediction using data-driven machine learning is feasible. Even for the very uncertain sports game, the predicted results give out some hints. We want to use machine learning methods to predict the game result in the World Cup, but how?

In this project, the aim is very direct; we are going to predict the World Cup games using machine learning methods. 

I am learning these skills through the project:

- Data choices and collection for a sports prediction model
- Data importing 
- Data cleaning for a machine learning project
- Objects needed in machine learning object
- Conduct machine learning to know how to use the method to predict sports game
- Analyse machine learning model using LIME and SHAP
